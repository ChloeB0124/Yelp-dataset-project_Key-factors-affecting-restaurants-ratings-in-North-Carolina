# PROJECT YELP DATA 

Regarding the Yelp data set: US data set. Customer reviews of experiences with businesses from different industry sectors. Reviews are voted on by others on three characteristics (usefulness of the review, coolness of the review, and how funny the review was). Industry sector and time of observation are included.Updated recently, n = 898,483; 9 different measures. The following problems must be investigated:
1. Which type of industry sector generally,  gets the highest and lowest star ratings (the highest and lowest satisfaction)? Can we determine why this might be the case? That is, what are the main drivers of high and low star ratings?
2. Within the highest and lowest rated industry sectors, has satisfaction (the star rating) changed over time?
3. Can we predict the rating for any of the industry sectors included in the data set at some time in the future? 
4. Is there something driving how other people consider the review
5. Recommend ways that the industry sectors that had the poorest reviews, might improve their customer star rating. 
6. Is there something in this data (trend, relationship or otherwise), that you find interesting?
# STAGE 1: 
The first part of the project focuses on understanding the problem, preparation and modelling the data provided, and developing some preliminary hypotheses towards solving the problem.
# STAGE 2: 
The second part of the project focuses on understanding the problem, preparation and modelling the data provided, and developing advanced analytics methods to test the hypotheses developed as part of stage 1. That is, a demonstration of how you prepared and then used advanced analytical techniques using your chosen software.

Reports are included for each stage.
